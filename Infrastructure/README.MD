# Deploying Votesy!
The fun part of this app is deploying it! We have options to deploy the application into the following infrastructure:

* Locally using docker compose.
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Azure Container Apps

### Step 1, lets connect to our Azure Subscription.
az login
az account set --subscription "subsciption name"

### Step 2, regardless of which method we choose, we need to create a storage account in the resource group.
Run the following command:
```
az deployment group create --resource-group votesy-rg --template-file storage.bicep
```

When the command prompts for a location, type in the preferred location.

```
Please provide string value for 'location' (? for help):
```

## Instructions for Docker Compose

With the new storage account created, you will need to get the connection string, and the key from the "ðŸ”‘ Access Keys" section. Add these elements into the .env file.

```
STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=""
KEY=""
```

Then execute the following command:

```
docker compose --file docker-compose.yml --env-file .env up
```

Once everything is up (and provided there are no errors) navigate to...

```
http://localhost:5002/
```
...to see the site in action.
