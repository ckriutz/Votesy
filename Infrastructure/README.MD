# Deploying Votesy!
The fun part of this app is deploying it! We have options to deploy the application into the following infrastructure:

* Locally using docker compose.
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Azure Container Apps

### Step 1, lets connect to our Azure Subscription.
az login
az account set --subscription "subsciption name"

### Step 2, regardless of which method we choose, we need to create a storage account in the resource group.
Run the following command:
```
az deployment group create --resource-group rg-votesy --template-file storage.bicep
```

When the command prompts for a location, type in the preferred location.
ðŸš€ If planning on deploying into Azure Container Apps, or Azure Azure Kubernetes Service, ideally choose **eastus2**.

```
Please provide string value for 'location' (? for help):
```

## Instructions for Docker Compose

With the new storage account created, you will need to get the connection string, and the key from the "ðŸ”‘ Access Keys" section. Add these elements into the .env file.

![Access Keys](./images/access_keys.png)
![Keys](./images/key1.png)

```
KEY=""
STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=""
```

Then execute the following command:

```
docker compose --file docker-compose.yml --env-file .env up
```

Once everything is up (and provided there are no errors) navigate to...

```
http://localhost:5002/
```
...to see the site in action.

When you're done, run this command to bring everything down:

```
docker compose --file docker-compose.yml --env-file .env down

```

## Instructions for Azure Container Apps

We want to make sure we are deploying everything into the same resource group, and in a region that supports Azure Container Apps. As of the time of this writing, it's not available in every region. [Check here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=container-apps) for the current regions. Right now, we are going to focus creating everything in **eastus2**.

Running the following command will get things going, creating us a resource group, a storage account, and a container registry. Make note of the name of the new container registry.

```
az deployment create --template-file supporting-infra.bicep --location eastus2
```

Now, we can build and push the container images to the registry. From the Infrastructure folder, run these commands:

```
$env:REGISTRY = "<registry_name>" 

az acr build -f ../votesy-api/Dockerfile -t votesy-api -r $env:REGISTRY ../votesy-api
az acr build -f ../votesy-web/Dockerfile -t votesy-web -r $env:REGISTRY ../votesy-web
az acr build -f ../Votesy.Results/Dockerfile -t votesy-results -r $env:REGISTRY ../Votesy.Results
az acr build -f ../Votesy.Service/Dockerfile -t votesy-service -r $env:REGISTRY ../Votesy.Service
```

With these images in the registry, it's time to create the container app.

$env:ACRUSER=$(az acr credential show -n $env:REGISTRY --query username -o tsv)
$env:ACRPASSWORD=$(az acr credential show -n $env:REGISTRY --query "passwords[0].value" -o tsv)

$env:CONNECTIONSTRING = "<connection_string>"
$env:KEY = "<key>"
$env:STORAGENAME ="<name_of_storage_account>"

az deployment group create -n container-app -g rg-votesy --template-file ./container-app-main.bicep -p registry=<registry_name> registryUsername=$env:ACRUSER registryPassword=$env:ACRPASSWORD storageConnectionString=$env:CONNECTIONSTRING storageKey=$env:KEY storageName=$env:STORAGENAME
